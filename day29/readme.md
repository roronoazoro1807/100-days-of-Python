# Day 29 - Password Manager App

## What I Learned:

- **Python Basics:** Implementing functions, handling user inputs with `Tkinter`, and creating interactive GUI applications.
  
- **Password Management:** Storing and handling password generation securely with proper user validation.
  
- **Password Strength Checking:** Developing a password strength checker to evaluate password security using regular expressions.
  
- **Clipboard Management:** Using the `pyperclip` library to automatically copy generated passwords to the clipboard.

- **Real-time Feedback:** Creating an interactive system that provides immediate feedback on password strength, guiding users to improve their passwords.

## Additional Features Added

### Real-time Password Strength Feedback:
- The application provides real-time feedback as the user types their password, checking for length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
  
- Displaying suggestions for improving password strength, such as adding uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

### Password Generation:
- A password generator that combines letters, numbers, and symbols to create a strong, random password.
  
- After generating a password, the system automatically copies it to the clipboard for easy use.

### Password Storage:
- The app allows users to save their passwords, associated websites, and emails in a local text file (`data.txt`).
  
- A confirmation message is displayed to ensure that the user wants to save the credentials.

### Enhanced User Experience:
- Added a `password strength` indicator, showing the strength of the password in real-time as users type or generate passwords.
  
- Included feedback that shows the necessary steps for improving weak passwords, such as adding numbers, symbols, or changing the length.

### Improved Comments and Readability:
- I added clear comments throughout the code to explain the functionality of different sections, making it easier to understand and maintain.

Feel free to try it out, generate strong passwords, and suggest any improvements! üîêüíª
